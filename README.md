# Various Allocators For Modern C++

***This is a work in progress.***

This repository contains various allocators for C++20 or above.
Performance is the main focus, but the allocators are also designed to be easy to use, with STL or separately.

Thread safety is not guaranteed, check the documentation of each allocator for more information.
